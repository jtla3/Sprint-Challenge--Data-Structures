# Data Structure II Sprint Challenge

1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?

## Stacks
  * Stacks order of insertion is last in first out. I would used `.push()` to add to stack and `.pop()` to remove a stack.

## Queue
  * Queue order of insertion is first in first out, kinda like a line at the counter. You use `enque` to add and `deque` to remove.

2. What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?

## Linked List

  * The retreival method for Linked List is O(n). O(n) constitutes a linear memory usage. So more input means linearly more memory. You would have to search it by checking each element.

## Hash Table

  * Time complexity in Big O notation is O(1) for an average case. Which means that no matter how much data it has it will execute in constant time. It is the fastest. An example would be a dictionary.

## Binary Search Tree

  * Time complexity in Big O notation is O(log n). It means it has iterate over every node in the tree to find the right node.

3. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

  * Some of the advantages of the using a Hash Table or an array is Hashes provide constant time lookups by key as opposed to    constant time lookups by index. A dictionary look up would be easier looking up.
